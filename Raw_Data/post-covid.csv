"Notes"
"Adults having symptoms of anxiety disorder were determined based on having a score of three or greater on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale. These adults have symptoms of anxiety that generally occur more than half the days or nearly every day. The GAD-2 questions adapted for the Household Pulse Survey are: ""Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?"" and ""Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by the following problems: Not being able to stop or control worrying? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?""."

"Adults having symptoms of depressive disorder were determined based on having a score of three or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) scale. These adults have symptoms of depression that generally occur more than half the days or nearly every day. The PHQ-2 questions adapted for the Household Pulse Survey are: ""Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?"" and ""Over the last 7 days, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Would you say not at all, several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?""."
